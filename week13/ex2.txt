Let us consider possibilities:
Avoidance is the best in case when there are a lot of processes and very few resource operations: Prevention will work slower due to high number of processes (and their processing is complicated by the Prevention); Recovery also seems to be worse in this case, as there may be situation when several processes should be killed and restored so that deadlock disappear.
Prevention is the best in case when there are few long processes and a lot of resource allocation/deallocation: Avoidance will work slower on resource checks, Recovery will work worse because if rollback done in such intensive process (a lot of management done), then its re-execution will last for a long time.
Recovery is the best in case of many lightweight processes, which mostly transfer the resources - then rollback will be more efficient than additional load on Avoidance at each resource operation or pre-processing of multiple processes with Prevention.
