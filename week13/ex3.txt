Deadlock situation may occur if each philosopher has 1 fork in his hand and can not pick another one. It may happen if his neighbour holds required fork and doesn't want to free it. So we have to invent way of freing fork so that it will be picked by the neighbour.
One way is to put some person in order to manage philosophers: he/she may get information from all the philosophers and decide who should do what - I mean, this person may manage which philosopher picks which fork if he wants etc. So person collects information about which philosopher wants to eat, and if both forks are free, then ask him to pick both of them; otherwise - add hungry philosopher in queue and wait until both forks are free.
Another case is to give commands for a philosophers: for example we may set numbers for the forks 1...5 and say: "Hey! If you are sitting near the fork #2 or #4, then first fork which you pick should be not one, mentioned before (otherwise pick any); if you fail to pick a fork, try to do it in a minute".
