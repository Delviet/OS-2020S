Probably stdout is buffered in such a way that it is freed after the use of new line symbol.
So, in the first case buffered is copied for both processes and after that freed after the fork, so result is printed twice.
In the second case, buffer is freed, so at the fork moment there is no "Hello" inside it, hence "\n" just move to the new line, without printing "Hello".
